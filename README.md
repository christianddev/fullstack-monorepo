### Challenge

Create a drawing web application that allows users to draw/sketch on an empty piece of “paper”
and upload it to a public list of drawings.

Each uploaded drawing will be saved in a persistence layer of your choosing on the backend.
IMPORTANT NOTE: The drawings should not be persisted as bitmaps. This is important for
dealing with different display sizes and for keeping the original data instead of a bitmap
representation.
