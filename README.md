> Challenge: Create a drawing web application that allows users to draw/sketch on an empty piece of “paper” and upload it to a public list of drawings.
> Each uploaded drawing will be saved in a persistence layer of your choosing on the backend.
> NOTE: The drawings should not be persisted as bitmaps.
